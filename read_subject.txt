- routine for philosophers -> eat, sleep, etc.
- main that starts all the threads and supervises behaviour
- dead flag, to indicate whether one philo died as exit condition
- 

- use hellgrind and fsanitize threads

- let everyone finish their routine
- just dont print any more messages, if status is dead -> check if status is dead before printing

- unlock all mutexes in the end in main when one philo dies, so no other philo will be stuck somehwhere
